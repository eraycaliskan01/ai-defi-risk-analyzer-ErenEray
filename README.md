## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing risk levels of DeFi protocols using an AI-based risk scoring mechanism and recording the results on the blockchain.

The system demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence can be combined with Blockchain technology to provide transparent, immutable, and automated risk assessment for decentralized finance platforms.

## AI4Blockchain Classification

**Primary Domain:**  
- **AI4DeFi – Decentralized Finance Risk Assessment**

**AI Usage:**  
- Rule-based / lightweight ML risk scoring logic  
- Off-chain AI computation

**Blockchain Usage:**  
- On-chain storage of risk scores  
- Smart contract-based data integrity

---

## System Architecture

The system consists of four main components:

- **AI Backend:** Calculates DeFi risk scores
- **Smart Contracts:** Store and manage risk scores on Ethereum testnet
- **Scripts Layer:** Deploys contracts and updates risk values
- **Frontend:** Displays stored risk scores

AI computations are performed off-chain, while finalized results are written on-chain for transparency.

## Technologies Used

### AI / Backend
- Python
- Basic risk scoring logic

### Blockchain
- Solidity

## How the System Works

1. AI module calculates a DeFi protocol risk score.
2. Smart contract is deployed to an Ethereum test network.
3. Risk score is written to the blockchain using scripts.
4. Stored data can be viewed through a simple frontend.
